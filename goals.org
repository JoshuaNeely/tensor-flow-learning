#+title: Goals

* DONE Save and Load trained model from disk
CLOSED: [2023-02-12 Sun]

* TODO validate inputs are true to training set
might be 255 instead of 0-1...?

* TODO Live train model with user input to correct bad classifications
at this moment it's really struggling with 6s and 0s. Overtrained to 5s.

* TODO compose (trained?) model together as input (layer?) to another model

* TODO generate inputs that match state of model
"reverse" the flow of data
find all inputs that match a certain classification?

"auto encoders"
